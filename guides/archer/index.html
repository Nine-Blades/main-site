                <p>The Scout is Amtgard's archer and reconnaissance specialist. Scouts excel at ranged combat, tracking,
                    and providing battlefield intelligence. With their unique combination of archery, stealth, and
                    utility abilities, Scouts are versatile fighters who can adapt to many different combat situations.
                </p>

                <p>Scouts are one of the few classes that can effectively engage enemies from a distance, making them
                    valuable assets in both small skirmishes and large battles. Their tracking abilities also make them
                    excellent hunters during quests and special scenarios.</p>

                <p>This guide will help you understand the Scout's abilities, equipment, and strategies to become an
                    effective archer and reconnaissance specialist in the Kingdom of the Nine Blades.</p>

        <section class="class-section">
            <h2>Playing a Scout Effectively</h2>
            <p>To be an effective Scout, you need to understand your role on the battlefield and how to maximize your
                unique abilities:</p>

            <h3>Combat Strategy</h3>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li><strong>Maintain Distance:</strong> Your greatest advantage is range. Try to stay away from melee
                    combat where other classes have the advantage.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Terrain:</strong> Position yourself on high ground or behind cover to make it harder for
                    enemies to reach you.</li>
                <li><strong>Save Special Arrows:</strong> Don't use your special arrows (Stun, Flame, Phase) on easy
                    targets. Save them for armored opponents or critical moments.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Your Team:</strong> Focus fire on enemies engaging your teammates, especially
                    healers or other vulnerable allies.</li>
                <li><strong>Know When to Retreat:</strong> If enemies close in on you, don't hesitate to fall back to
                    your team's line.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reconnaissance</h3>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li><strong>Scout Ahead:</strong> Use your Tracking and Camouflage abilities to gather information about
                    enemy positions and movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Report Back:</strong> Information is only valuable if shared. Make sure to communicate what
                    you've learned to your team.</li>
                <li><strong>Mark Targets:</strong> Call out high-value targets for your team to focus on.</li>
            </ul>
